# Design Patterns

A design pattern is used to identify reusable solutions that can be applied to recurring problems that software developers commonly face during software design/ They represent time-tested solutions and best practices adopted by object-oriented software developers over time.

Design patterns can be considered pre-made blueprints applied to solve a particular design problem. It is not a finished piece of code that can be directly applied to your program.

## Structure of a Design Pattern

| Term       | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intent     | Describes what the pattern does - the problem and the solution.                                       |
| Motivation | Further explains the problem and how the pattern solves that problem.                                 |
| Structure  | Set of diagrams of the classes and objects that depict parts of the pattern and how they are related. |
| Code       | Example in any popular language for a better grasp of the idea.                                       |

## Why use Design Patterns?

The key benefits to using design patterns are:

- Avoid reinventing the wheel
- Codebase maintenance
- Easily reused
- Enables efficient communication
- Improves your object-oriented skills

## Categories of Design Pattern

Based on intent, the JavaScript design patterns can be categorised into 3 major groups:

1. Creational Design Patterns

These patterns focus on handling object creation mechanisms. A basic object creation approach in a program can lead to an added complexity. Creational design patterns aim to solve this problem by controlling the creation process.

2. Structural Design Patterns

These patterns are concerned with object composition. They explain simple ways to assemble objects and classes into larger structures. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system, doesn't need to do the same, keeping them flexible and efficient.

3. Behavioural Design Patterns

These patterns focus on improving the communication and assignment of responsibilities between dissimilar objects in a system.
