# Structural Design Patterns

These patterns are concerned with object composition. They explain simple ways to assemble objects and classes into larger structures. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn't need to do the same, keeping them flexible and efficient.

Structural Patterns include:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy
