# Linked Lists

Linked lists are a data structure which do not use physical placement of data in memory. This means that, rather than indexed or positions, linked lists use a referencing system: elements are stored in nodes that contain a pointer to the next node, repeating until all nodes are linked.

This system allows efficient insertion and removal of items without hte need for reorganisation.

- Advantages
  - Efficient insertion and removal of new elements
  - Less complex than restructuring an array
- Disadvantages
  - Use more memory than arrays
  - Inefficient to retrieve a specific element
  - Inefficient to traverse the list backwards
