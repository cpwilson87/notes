# Data Structures

A Data structure is a way to store, organise, and manage information (or data) in a way that allows you the programmer to easily access or modify the values within them.

Data structures enable us to:

- Manage and utilise large datasets
- Search for particular data from a database
- Design algorithms that are tailored towards particular programs
- Handle multiple requests from users at once
- Simplify and speed up data processing.
