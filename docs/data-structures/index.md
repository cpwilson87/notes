# Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organising data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

Data structures enable us to:

- Manage and utilise large datasets
- Search for particular data from a database
- Design algorithms that are tailored towards particular programs
- Handle multiple requests from users at once
- Simplify and speed up data processing.

## Types of Data Structures

### Linear

A linear data structure has data elements arranged in a sequential manner and each member element is connected to its previous and next element. This connection helps to traverse a linear data structure in a single level and in single run. Such data structures are easy to implement as computer memory is also sequential.

Examples of linear data structures are:

- [Arrays](./arrays.md)
- [Linked Lists](./linked-lists.md)
- [Stacks](./stacks.md)
- [Queues](./queues.md)

### Trees

- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap

- Hash

  - Hash Tables

- Graphs

  - Graph
  - Tries
  - Segment Tree
  - Suffix Tree
