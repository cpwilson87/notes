# Dictionary

Dictionaries are one of the most abstract data structures covered. They are also called maps and associative arrays. They store values in the form of key/value pairs.

We index dictionaries using these keys instead of a numerical index. The keys and values in a key/value pairs can be pretty much any primitive data type.

There are 2 extremely important restrictions when it comes to dictionaries.

- Every key can only appear once within the dictionary
- Each key can only have one value
