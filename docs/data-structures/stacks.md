# Stacks

The stack is a sequential access data structure in which we add elements and remove according to the LIFO principle (last in, first out).

Stacks come with common methods:

- push - add data to stack
- pop - remove data from the stack
- peek - retrieves the value at the top of the stack without removing it
- contains - searches through the stack returning a boolean
